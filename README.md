# bricks

School project in Swift to build a iOS application to teach children to code. In the app, children use lego-like algorithmic blocks to design their very first programs, using logical statements (if/else) and actions on the phone (turn on the flashlight, vibrate, etc.).

Since Swift does not allow executing code encapsulated in a string, the « mini-language » is encoded in a tree, where each node is a block, whose successor are any allowed subsequent block.
